You may ask: Why is this game called Earnesto's Crusade? 

Well, I've got an answer for you. It was replit's idea!

<p>
<B><u>IDEAS:

- Add upgrades

- Make a way to acquire new items/abilities in the case of  Magi

- Add code for all those abilities/items maybe piggy backing off the item box structure

- Add an inventory, maybe using a python dictionary

- The name of the player is Earnesto, but maybe add a start/customization menu 

- Class choices: Soldier (rifle), Ranger (bow), Magi (spells)
